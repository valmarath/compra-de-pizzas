Compra de Pizzas (Order a Pizza) is a project made alongside my course in [B7Web](https://b7web.com.br/fullstack/?gclid=EAIaIQobChMI-7eYj5vT-QIVEz6RCh2VfgXQEAAYASAAEgJfifD_BwE&ref=I24108426I) in order to practice JavaScript. It simulates the experience of buying, on a website (desktop and mobile), one or more pizzas of different types and sizes.

## See Order a Pizza in action

- Download all files and open the [index.html](https://github.com/valmarath/compra-de-pizzas/blob/main/index.html) file on your browser.

- To test the application, select one type of pizza and click on it, then chose the size and quantity and add to your cart. After this, you'll be able to add more pizzas by doing the same process, as well as changing the quantity to 0 and excluding the pizzas already added. The project was focused on JavaScript for front-end purposes, s√≥ nohting will happen if you click on the "Finalizar a compra" button and so forth. 

- To see the responsive features, you can use the inspect option to change the dimensions as you please and see how it responds.

- To add more types of pizzas, update the [pizzas.js](https://github.com/valmarath/compra-de-pizzas/blob/main/pizzas.js).

- To understand exactly how the script works and to test some of the features proposed, see the [script.js](https://github.com/valmarath/compra-de-pizzas/blob/main/script.js).
